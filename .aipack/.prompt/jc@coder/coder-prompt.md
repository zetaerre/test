some refactoring to do :
- extract the js into `js/main.js` and css into `css\main.css`
- make the main.js script tag type module
- split the main.js into 
    - `main.js`  for the entrypoint
    - `app.js` for the game/app logic
    - `cv-utils.js` for the canvas primitives, utilities, and common elements

I'll refactor the code by extracting the JavaScript and CSS into separate files, and organizing the JavaScript code into the requested structure. Here are the updated files:






This refactoring separates the code into the requested modules:

1. The CSS has been moved to `css/main.css`
2. The JavaScript has been split into three modules:
   - `main.js` - Entry point that initializes the game
   - `app.js` - Core game logic including physics, collision detection, and game state
   - `cv-utils.js` - Canvas utility functions for drawing game elements

The script tag in the HTML file has been updated to type "module" to support ES6 module imports/exports. The overall functionality of the game remains the same, but the code is now better organized and more maintainable.
