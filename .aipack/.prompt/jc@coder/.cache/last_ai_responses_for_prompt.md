I'll refactor the code by extracting the JavaScript and CSS into separate files, and organizing the JavaScript code into the requested structure. Here are the updated files:






This refactoring separates the code into the requested modules:

1. The CSS has been moved to `css/main.css`
2. The JavaScript has been split into three modules:
   - `main.js` - Entry point that initializes the game
   - `app.js` - Core game logic including physics, collision detection, and game state
   - `cv-utils.js` - Canvas utility functions for drawing game elements

The script tag in the HTML file has been updated to type "module" to support ES6 module imports/exports. The overall functionality of the game remains the same, but the code is now better organized and more maintainable.
