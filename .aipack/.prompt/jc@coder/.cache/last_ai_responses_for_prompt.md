I see that you already have a functional Pong game in the index.html file that meets all your requirements. Let me review it and see if there are any improvements that can be made:

1. The game already uses Canvas2D for rendering
2. The player (left) paddle is controlled by the mouse
3. The canvas resizes with the window and maintains a 16px margin
4. Everything is contained in a single index.html file

The code is well-structured and includes:
- Game constants and variables
- Proper initialization
- Event handling for mouse movement and window resizing
- Game loop with update and render functions
- Ball physics with collision detection
- Computer AI opponent
- Score tracking and display

The game is fully functional as is. Do you want me to make any specific improvements or changes to the existing implementation?
